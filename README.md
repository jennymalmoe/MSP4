## UX

## Project Goals

<br>

The purpose of this project is to 

*"...build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service"* using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, a relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres), Stripe payments
and possible additional libraries and API's. 

**Value provided:**
1. By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site.
2. The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available to paid users without paying.

This project has a full set of CRUD (creation, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features. CRUD at user interface level:

|Operation|SQL|HTTP|DDS|Description|
|---|----|----|----|----|
|**Create**|INSERT|PUT/POST|Write|Create a resource: Users can create profiles by signing up. Users can create orders by adding items to bag annd then follow the checkout procedure. Users can create a blog post in BOHO Blog page. Admin can create products and blog posts.
|**Read**|SELECT|GET|Read|Retrieve a resource: Users can retrieve, search and view products.
|**Update**|UPDATE|PUT/PATCH/POST|Write|Update a resource: Users can update/edit the delivery information. Admin can update/edit products and blog posts.
|**Delete**|DELETE|DELETE|Dispose|Delete a resource: Admin can delete products, registered users and blog posts.

## Business Goals

<br>

This e-commerce website focus on maximizing direct sales to new and returning customers (convert a website visitor into a customer) by simplify and optimize content to be easy to shop by a user friendly and well designed online shop that enables secure purchases and inspires. Also establishing brand recognition in the industry. Mission statement: *"To offer quality, popular and affordable boho inspired hoeme decor and fashion".* 

### Target audience

The target audience for B.L is potential customers liking the bohemian style in home decor and fashion. Since this is e-commerce the conversions is the most important part, rather than traffic it self. Conversions take place when targeted traffic meets relevant offer. So it's important that B.L clearly defined what they offers. To avoid irrelevant traffic B.L makes it clear already in its name that thos is boho inspired e-commerce. By basic SEO and a distinct website (mainly the anding page) B.L defines that they offer boho inspired homedecor and fashion. E-commerce sales increaces worldwide, and develop the need to determine target audience, particularly ecommerce stores. B.L ideal customer is a person that likes/has a boho inpired lifestyle, more than demographic data. Online, the location matters less due to home delivery. Age is not what it used to be, the age isn't the defining thing if somebody turns out to be a paying customer. Conversions take place when targeted traffic meets relevant offer, thats why B.L has a really well defined business name, website and offer. 

After created this customer profile, B.L can make use of demographical information, such as name, address, user behavior etc. B.L get the customers details when filling out the order form, where they also can get access to the newsletter. 

In addition to the goals above;

## Design Choices

<br>

* Color scheme
    
    The page consists of a white base with black, orange and yellow as accent colors. The combination of black and white offers the maximum contrast possible, as they come from opposite ends of the color spectrum. Black and white websites are classical, strong, and powerful. Apart from black and white being a risk-free combination and ensuring a design will look clean, removing color forces a designer to rely on other elements in their web designs such as typography, layout, or grid to catch the viewers' attention. Boho style/the products has asymmetrical layouts, variegated patterns and handcrafted textures. Placed in a clean, contemporary space, layers of colorful textiles deliver an unexpected twist. Thats what I had in mind chosing colors and style for this website.  
    
    Orange is an attention-grabbing color that tends to stand out visually as an accent standing out against neutral colors. The color orange is often associated with spiritual practices including meditation and compassion, as well as warmth, creativity and emotions. Orange has very high visibility, you can use it to draw attention and highlight the most important elements of your design. I used it as a compliment to the crisp and clean white and black colors. 

    I've used yellow text shadows in a few different places at the site. This bright yellow is an attention-getter, and its contrast with white or black is one of the most visible color combinations. 

    All buttons are either black, white or orange.

* Typography

    Lato is an open source, sans-serif font. Lato font is the main font used throughout the site with Architects Daughter font used to headers and logo. The font is created to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. Lato is used in the body content for the site to appear to be approachable which is the main goal for this website. 
    
    Architects Daughter font incorporates the graphic, squared look of architectural writing, combined with the natural feel of daily handwriting. It is clean but unconventional and gives the site a relaxed vibe. The combination of these two fonts represents both the webshop/business side aswell as the relaxed boho approach. 

    ![Fonts](media/fonts.png)

* Imagery

    Images and the choices of the images is an important component of this site. The hero image on the landing page gives the site a dramatic appearance and sets the tone for the boho inspired page. I use lot of space around images and content to get the visitor an uncluttered and comfortable browsing experience on all device sizes. The product images for the e-commerce part of the site is chosen to be more artistic than detailed to fit the boho-tone. The appearance is aiming to be appealing to the target audience. 

* Icons

    All icons used are taken from Font Awsome. The use of icons in web design is a proven method to modernize a website and help direct user flow. Adding icons to the site's content helps a user better process the information and provides a visual focus point that grounds a user to a specific section. I used an arrow icon recurring throughout the site, to improve visual interest and grab the user's attention.

While the project relied on these wireframes, there are some differences between the wireframes and the final product; 

* No spinner icon while Stripe payment is processing.

bug2:changed js from $('toast').toast('show') to 
{% block postloadjs %}
      <script type="text/javascript">
          $('.toast').show()
      </script>

    notification/success messages didn't show. 

bug3: needed data-bs-autohide="false" BS pga bootstrap 5.

If user accendentally or intentionally closes the browser window after the payment is confirmed but before the form is submitted, there would be a payment in stripe but no order in our database. to prevent this situation I've build in some redundancy, each time an event occurs on stripe (such as a payment intent being created) a payment being completed on stripe a webhook is sent out that we can listen for. webhooks are like the signals django sends each time a model is saved or deleted. except that they are sent securely from stripe to a url we specify.

bug register my account got an SMTPAuthenticationError at /accounts/signup/. whenever I tried registrate a new user, it said "Already have an account? Then please sign in." I had DEVELOPMENT in my gitpod settings, but scope was set for my msp3 not to my msp4 or */* (to access all). It was trying to use the gmail smtp from Gitpod but gmail was expecting the Heroku app to access it, so it wasn't authenticated and thats why it didn't work.

bug when stripe no confirmation mail in terminal 404 error, "edit webhook endpoint" in stripe and then got an 200 error in terminal, payment_intent.succeeded in stripe, but no conf mail still,  then changed from private to public  8000 port. Well, the webhook itself wasn't set up quite right either, so a combo. (STRIPE_WH_SECRET not KEY till slut) sÃ¥ det va det och att the webhook it self wasn't set up right. added 8000- i bÃ¶rjan and checkout/wh/ in the end. 

So a word of warning about your webhooks still. This all works fine for your local endpoint, but if you're going to use the heroku one it will need a different WH_SECRET_KEY in your Heroku cvars. You can find this by Reveal the signing secret you find for the heroku endpoint in Stripe website. So both local and deployed site have the same STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY but they will have different STRIPE_WH_SECRET.

 


bug: confirmations page and success toast don't show after a purchase. I remove line 82 and 95 in js checkout. county field removed but forgot to remove it from js, only removed it (county) in forms and models etc. 

bug: modal disappeared direkt, fick byta type="submit" till type="button". the button was in a <form> that was temporarily just fetching the same page.I fixed this by adding type="button" to the button element, so that it wouldn't submit the form when clicked.
Bug: pga ovan att type Ã¤r button o inte submit sÃ¥ funkar inte required. 

OBS known bug ("On some iOS devices, this happens....") bug: nothing happens when I click "Register" or "Login" (if I am not signed in) after added item(s) in the bag (=toast). after loged in nothing happens when clicking my profile. logout, need to refresh to be able to. 

The development process is clearly evident through detailed commit messages.
